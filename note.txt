--If the parent directory isn't in the python path, the login.py won't run--
A quick fix is to Set the PYTHONPATH for the current session by running the following command, replacing the path with the absolute path to your project directory
which in my case I did it with this command-
"set PYTHONPATH=E:\Projects\Selenium\SeleniumPython\Web_Automation_POM_UnitTest_HTMLReports\pythonProject1"
then simply run the command "python login.py" from the Tests folder, and the test will run
